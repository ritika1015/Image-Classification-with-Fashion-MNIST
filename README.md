   # Abstract

Image classification problem can be solved by many different models and techniques. This project aims to gain a deeper understanding on classification of models and their performance on Fashion-MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000, 28x28 greyscale images from 10 different categories, where the training set contains 60,000 samples and the testing set contains 10,000 samples of images. The Fashion-MNIST dataset intends to be a drop, in place of numeric-MNIST dataset, as the image shares the same size, same data format and the same training and testing structure.
